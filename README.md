# Pandio Trino Demonstration

The purpose of this repository is to give a full demonstration of Trino.

This demo runs Trino 354, MySQL, and PostgreSQL within Docker.

This demo loads test data into a MySQL database and test data into a PostgreSQL database, then executes a select across both databases in a single command.

## Requirements

Python 3.5-3.8

Docker Engine 20+

Mac OS X / Linux

## Steps

1. Open terminal window and run `./run.sh`

1. Open second terminal window and run `./demo.sh`

This will output 10 rows from the random data inserted into each database.
